## Code Overview

The code is structured in the following manner:

1. Necessary libraries are included at the beginning of the code.
2. Global variables are declared, including a trade object, magic number for trade identification, and stop loss value in pips.
3. Custom functions are defined for historical data analysis, real-time analysis, creating a user-friendly interface, and customizing parameters.
4. The `OnInit()` function serves as the entry point of the program and initializes the trade object, performs historical data analysis, real-time analysis, creates the user-friendly interface, and customizes parameters.
5. The `OnTick()` function is the main program loop and is executed on each tick. Necessary actions are performed in this function.
6. The `OnDeinit()` function is executed before program termination and performs clean-up actions.

Please note that certain parts of the code have been omitted and marked with comments (`// ...`). These sections should be filled with the appropriate code for retrieving historical data, applying the proprietary algorithm for reversal point prediction, identifying turning points in the price action, notifying traders about potential trade opportunities, and placing trades based on identified reversal points.

## How it Works

The Reversal Point MT4 software works by analyzing historical and real-time market data to identify potential reversal points in the price action. It applies a proprietary algorithm to predict these reversal points and then notifies traders about potential trade entry or exit opportunities. The software also allows traders to customize certain parameters to suit their trading preferences.

To use the software, traders need to follow these steps:

1. Set the magic number for trade identification and the stop loss value in pips.
2. Initialize the trade object and set the expert magic number.
3. Analyze historical data by retrieving it from the Forex market and applying the proprietary algorithm for reversal point prediction.
4. Perform real-time analysis by continuously retrieving real-time market data, applying the unique algorithm, identifying turning points, and notifying traders about potential trade opportunities.
5. Create a user-friendly interface for traders to interact with the software.
6. Customize parameters based on traders' preferences.
7. On each tick, perform necessary actions such as placing trades based on the identified reversal points.
8. Before termination, clean up and perform necessary actions.

Please note that the specific implementation of retrieving historical and real-time market data, applying the proprietary algorithm, identifying turning points, notifying traders, and placing trades is not provided in the code. Traders need to fill in these sections with their own code or consult the official developer of the product for more information.
